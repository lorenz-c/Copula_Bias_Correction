%   Bayesian Copula Selection
%   Return the weight of each copula family.
%
%   INPUT   
%       FAMILY    : Subset of {'Ind' 'Gumbel' 'Clayton' 'Frank' 'AMH' 'Joe' 'Arch12' 'Arch14'}
%       U         : Nx2 matrix of quantiles (u,v).
%       BOUNDARIES: Integration boundaries on Kendall's tau 
%                   Default: [-.95,.95])
%       PRIOR_TAU : Function handle returning the parent prior for TAU. 
%                   Default is uniform over the domain of tau covered by each copula.
%
%   OUTPUT
%       P         : The weight of each copula family.
%
%   NOTES
%       A prior for the model is applied, proportional to 1/Lambda,
%       where Lambda is the interval spanned by Kendall's tau. This 
%       interval is equal the intersection of the copula boundaries 
%       on tau and the boundaries specified by the user. 
%
%       For some data and parameters, the pdf returned by copulapdf is Inf
%       or 0, which ruins the integration. To avoid this problem, try to
%       restrict the integration domain (do not use [-1,1], this won't
%       work, [.-97, .97] is a better choice, and even then, problems may
%       appear).
